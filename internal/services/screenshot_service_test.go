```
The tests for `internal/services/screenshot_service.go` are created.
- `TestTakeScreenshotFromHTML_OptionHandling`: This test focuses on the option processing logic within `TakeScreenshotFromHTML`. Since `chromedp` requires a running browser environment, which is not suitable for a simple unit test, this test expects `TakeScreenshotFromHTML` to error out (e.g., connection failure, timeout). The key is that it *attempts* to run, implying the options were processed up to that point. The test cases cover default options, custom PNG, custom JPEG full page, and edge cases for JPEG quality. True verification of options passed to `chromedp` would require more complex mocking or refactoring.
- `TestDetermineFormat`: This is a straightforward unit test for the unexported helper function `determineFormat`, checking its logic based on `ScreenshotOptions`.

Next, I will create `internal/handlers/screenshot_handler_test.go` and write tests for the `ScreenshotHandler`.
